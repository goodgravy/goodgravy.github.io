      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://teespring.com/&#34;&gt;Teespring&lt;/a&gt; we have quarterly hackathons. We all throw suggestions into a melting-pot of ideas in the run-up to the event, with the most promising, most interesting, and most popular suggestions graduating to being hacked on by a small team for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dodocase.com/collections/virtual-reality&#34;&gt;DODOcase&lt;/a&gt; had given me a couple of Google Cardboard-based virtual reality viewers that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to playing with yet, and this hackathon was the perfect opportunity to have a play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea was to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/&#34;&gt;Virtual Reality capabilities in WebGL&lt;/a&gt; to give a Cardboard-equipped customer a 3D virtual preview of the product. This is still experimental stuff, but well-supported in all modern mobile browsers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prove the idea was even vaguely possible, and to give my Hackathon pitch some substance, I put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmsbrdy.com/vr-campaign.html&#34;&gt;this quick-and-dirty prototype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I didn&amp;rsquo;t move the idea past this prototype stage (and ended up hacking on machine learning fraud detection insteadâ€¦ more on that another time maybe), but I was surprised by how easy it was to get VR working on my phone browser, and how well it performed!&lt;/p&gt;
