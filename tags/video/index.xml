      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t video player controls seem dumb?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop and web-based players alike allow the user to jump forwards or backwards by 5 or 10 seconds, or possibly speed up and slow down playback. These controls operate identically no matter what the user is watching â€“ there&amp;rsquo;s no connection between the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; of the video, and the controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DVDs were the first format I know of that allowed you to skip via &lt;strong&gt;chapters&lt;/strong&gt;, but even something as basic as those coarse-grained content-aware controls aren&amp;rsquo;t available in things like YouTube videos today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea for how to identify the salient points in a video that a user might want to skip to: the good news is that this could all be done automatically, and with very little overhead; I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the bad news to the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
