      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to enjoy my job. I hope you do too. Figuring out clever solutions to difficult problems is innately satisfying. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt a yearning for various hobbies and side projects to augment the gratification I get from my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently gained some clarity about this yearning: what it is we are looking for, and why it&amp;rsquo;s important. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s something here that strikes a chord with you, and is of use.&lt;/p&gt;
