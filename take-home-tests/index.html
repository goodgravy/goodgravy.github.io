              <p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/">a discussion on Reddit</a> concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?</p>
<p>The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but <strong>virulently</strong> so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/dsw9cmk/">only one person</a> whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.</p>
<p>I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate. However, if they&rsquo;re approached in a thoughtful and careful way, they&rsquo;re one of the best tools for effective interviewing. Here&rsquo;s what I think does—and doesn&rsquo;t—work.</p>
<h2 id="what-doesnt-work">What doesn&rsquo;t work</h2>
<p>A poorly implemented take-home test can alienate candidates or fail to be a useful indicator of job performance—or both. Here&rsquo;s what to avoid:</p>
<h3 id="using-problems-unrelated-to-the-company-or-the-role">Using problems unrelated to the company or the role</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a well-worn adage that interviews are as much about the candidate assessing the company as the company assessing the candidate. For engineers especially, one of the key motivators for on-the-job satisfaction is whether they feel they&rsquo;re doing challenging, impactful work. As such, why would you give them anything else as part of a take-home test?</p>
<p>Some &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; question you found on the Internet and pose as a take-home challenge isn&rsquo;t going to give the candidate any insight whatsoever into the kinds of challenges and problem domain they may end up working in if they do eventually join your team.</p>
<p>Not only this, but generic questions absolutely feed the feeling of the process being yet another hoop the disinterested company need them to jump through, rather than a meaningful exchange and chance to learn. Perhaps this fuels the negativity surrounding the idea of such tests at all.</p>
<h3 id="checking-for-specific-pieces-of-knowledge">Checking for specific pieces of knowledge</h3>
<p>Do you <strong>really</strong> care whether the candidate has esoteric bits of knowledge at her or his fingertips? Are there APIs and algorithms they simply <strong>have</strong> to know off by heart?</p>
<p>Not only is the answer to those questions <em>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</em> for most roles, a take-home test is a poor way to check for such knowledge anyway.</p>
<p>When all human knowledge is effectively available to us 24/7, it becomes much more important that we can find, filter, and apply information and ideas, rather than them being sat in our heads. Any take-home test which requires the candidate to regurgitate specific knowledge is probably a waste of time.</p>
<p>Of course, for some roles, familiarity with a particular framework or language is crucial, but such familiarity can be tested by asking the candidate to solve a more general question. If they use the tools poorly—or fail to use the right ones at all—that&rsquo;s a better indicator than asking pop quiz-style questions about the tool itself.</p>
<h3 id="no-time-limit">No time limit</h3>
<p>We know that every piece of an interview process is extremely stressful for a candidate, so why not avoid a time limit to help make this piece less intense?</p>
<p>The answer is fairness and diversity.</p>
<p>We must remember that not every candidate has the same background situation. Perhaps a recent college graduate is willing and able to pull an all-nighter, fitting thirty-six hours of Monster-fuelled work into a weekend, but that&rsquo;s not true of most people. Perhaps the candidate has a family to care for, a health condition, a full-time job they can&rsquo;t take vacation from, …</p>
<p>We would hate to disadvantage people in a situation like that—and so should you. A time limit helps to ensure a level playing field between candidates.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-at-teespring">What we do at Teespring</h2>
<p>So, with all these pitfalls, why can take-home tests still be one of the best tools for effective interviewing?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An open-ended question without a single, clear solution lets the candidate show their &ldquo;personality&rdquo; in their solution. By personality, I mean their values and what they prioritise. If there&rsquo;s a time limit, do they still write tests? Is there documentation or some comments? Which language and/or frameworks did they think were the best fit for the job? As an interviewer you get to choose which traits or values are important to you and your team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the end of the time limit the candidate has become very familiar with the challenge: it means that we can dive right into the heart of a non-trivial problem if they do come to an on-site interview.  We care a lot about technical communication and analytical skills, and starting the interview with a common understanding of a shared problem lets us exercise those skills <strong>much</strong> more than if we had a cold start.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting it all together, at Teespring we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a take-home challenge based on a real piece of Teespring work. It is boiled down into something approachable in a time limit, but in essence it&rsquo;s very similar to a challenge we faced in our day-to-day work.</li>
<li>Set a three-hour time limit, so that it&rsquo;s fair across all candidates, and can be done in an evening or weekend without being <strong>too</strong> much of a burden.</li>
<li>Allow the candidate to use any language, framework, or tool that they want (we even had one solution in <a href="http://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a>!).</li>
<li>Care much more about the approach the candidate took rather than the raw algorithmic skill. It&rsquo;s relatively easy for us to learn new skills if we&rsquo;re faced with a daunting challenge, but it&rsquo;s really difficult and time-consuming to change someone&rsquo;s patterns of behaviour.</li>
</ul>
