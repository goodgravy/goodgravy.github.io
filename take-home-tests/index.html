<meta name="description" content="I recently came across a discussion on Reddit concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?

The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but virulently so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was only one person whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.

I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate.

              <p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/">a discussion on Reddit</a> concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?</p>

<p>The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but <strong>virulently</strong> so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/dsw9cmk/">only one person</a> whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.</p>

<p>I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate. However, if they&rsquo;re approached in a thoughtful and careful way, they&rsquo;re one of the best tools for effective interviewing. Here&rsquo;s what I think does—and doesn&rsquo;t—work.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="what-doesn-t-work">What doesn&rsquo;t work</h2>

<p>A poorly implemented take-home test can alienate candidates or fail to be a useful indicator of job performance—or both. Here&rsquo;s what to avoid:</p>

<h3 id="using-problems-unrelated-to-the-company-or-the-role">Using problems unrelated to the company or the role</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a well-worn adage that interviews are as much about the candidate assessing the company as the company assessing the candidate. For engineers especially, one of the key motivators for on-the-job satisfaction is whether they feel they&rsquo;re doing challenging, impactful work. As such, why would you give them anything else as part of a take-home test?</p>

<p>Some &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; question you found on the Internet and pose as a take-home challenge isn&rsquo;t going to give the candidate any insight whatsoever into the kinds of challenges and problem domain they may end up working in if they do eventually join your team.</p>

<p>Not only this, but generic questions absolutely feed the feeling of the process being yet another hoop the disinterested company need them to jump through, rather than a meaningful exchange and chance to learn. Perhaps this fuels the negativity surrounding the idea of such tests at all.</p>

<h3 id="checking-for-specific-pieces-of-knowledge">Checking for specific pieces of knowledge</h3>

<p>Do you <strong>really</strong> care whether the candidate has esoteric bits of knowledge at her or his fingertips? Are there APIs and algorithms they simply <strong>have</strong> to know off by heart?</p>

<p>Not only is the answer to those questions <em>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</em> for most roles, a take-home test is a poor way to check for such knowledge anyway.</p>

<p>When all human knowledge is effectively available to us <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, it becomes much more important that we can find, filter, and apply information and ideas, rather than them being sat in our heads. Any take-home test which requires the candidate to regurgitate specific knowledge is probably a waste of time.</p>

<p>Of course, for some roles, familiarity with a particular framework or language is crucial, but such familiarity can be tested by asking the candidate to solve a more general question. If they use the tools poorly—or fail to use the right ones at all—that&rsquo;s a better indicator than asking pop quiz-style questions about the tool itself.</p>

<h3 id="no-time-limit">No time limit</h3>

<p>We know that every piece of an interview process is extremely stressful for a candidate, so why not avoid a time limit to help make this piece less intense?</p>

<p>The answer is fairness and diversity.</p>

<p>We must remember that not every candidate has the same background situation. Perhaps a recent college graduate is willing and able to pull an all-nighter, fitting thirty-six hours of Monster-fuelled work into a weekend, but that&rsquo;s not true of most people. Perhaps the candidate has a family to care for, a health condition, a full-time job they can&rsquo;t take vacation from, …</p>

<p>We would hate to disadvantage people in a situation like that—and so should you. A time limit helps to ensure a level playing field between candidates.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-do-at-teespring">What we do at Teespring</h2>

<p>So, with all these pitfalls, why can take-home tests still be one of the best tools for effective interviewing?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An open-ended question without a single, clear solution lets the candidate show their &ldquo;personality&rdquo; in their solution. By personality, I mean their values and what they prioritise. If there&rsquo;s a time limit, do they still write tests? Is there documentation or some comments? Which language and/or frameworks did they think were the best fit for the job? As an interviewer you get to choose which traits or values are important to you and your team.</p></li>

<li><p>By the end of the time limit the candidate has become very familiar with the challenge: it means that we can dive right into the heart of a non-trivial problem if they do come to an on-site interview.  We care a lot about technical communication and analytical skills, and starting the interview with a common understanding of a shared problem lets us exercise those skills <strong>much</strong> more than if we had a cold start.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Putting it all together, at Teespring we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a take-home challenge based on a real piece of Teespring work. It is boiled down into something approachable in a time limit, but in essence it&rsquo;s very similar to a challenge we faced in our day-to-day work.</li>
<li>Set a three-hour time limit, so that it&rsquo;s fair across all candidates, and can be done in an evening or weekend without being <strong>too</strong> much of a burden.</li>
<li>Allow the candidate to use any language, framework, or tool that they want (we even had one solution in <a href="http://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a>!).</li>
<li>Care much more about the approach the candidate took rather than the raw algorithmic skill. It&rsquo;s relatively easy for us to learn new skills if we&rsquo;re faced with a daunting challenge, but it&rsquo;s really difficult and time-consuming to change someone&rsquo;s patterns of behaviour.</li>
</ul>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>We&rsquo;ve recently started using You Need A Budget (<a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a>) to plan our finances. Unfortunately, like most finance apps it&rsquo;s focussed squarely on the north american market: its automatic transaction importing only works for some US and Canadian banks – and we live and bank in Spain…</p>

<p>YNAB <strong>does</strong> support a manual process, where you upload QFX or OFX files – or CSVs (in their required format). However, our bank (<a href="https://www.bancsabadell.com">Sabadell</a>) supports neither QFX nor OFX, and their CSV format is markedly different from that which YNAB expects in the upload. We were stuck with the prospect of importing every single transaction by hand, or manually downloading a CSV from Sabadell and munging it into a shape that YNAB can understand.</p>

<p>Surely we can do better?</p>

<p>So became <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/ynabadell"><strong>ynabadell</strong></a> – a tool to automatically import transactions from Sabadell into your YNAB ledger.</p>

<p>Desktop and web-based players alike allow the user to jump forwards or backwards by 5 or 10 seconds, or possibly speed up and slow down playback. These controls operate identically no matter what the user is watching – there&rsquo;s no connection between the <strong>content</strong> of the video, and the controls.</p>

<p>DVDs were the first format I know of that allowed you to skip via <strong>chapters</strong>, but even something as basic as those coarse-grained content-aware controls aren&rsquo;t available in things like YouTube videos today.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for how to identify the salient points in a video that a user might want to skip to: the good news is that this could all be done automatically, and with very little overhead; I&rsquo;ll leave the bad news to the end!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>One of the main reasons InnoDB is the go-to choice for our MySQL tables is that it supports row-level locking<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This means that as we&rsquo;re reading from and writing to a table, we don&rsquo;t need to wait for <strong>all</strong> the other processes to finish up their work before we can get access to that table.</p>

<p>For larger tables, this ability to have multiple processes working on the same table at the same time is almost essential to get any level of decent performance, for most workloads.</p>

<p>However, we recently ran into a problem where – because of a detail of how InnoDB and MySQL work – we ended up doing table-level locking rather than row-level, with disastrous results.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/">a discussion on Reddit</a> concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?</p>

<p>The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but <strong>virulently</strong> so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/dsw9cmk/">only one person</a> whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.</p>

<p>I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate. However, if they&rsquo;re approached in a thoughtful and careful way, they&rsquo;re one of the best tools for effective interviewing. Here&rsquo;s what I think does—and doesn&rsquo;t—work.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I&rsquo;m currently learning Catalan and Spanish, and am reminded every day of the languages&rsquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">shared ancestor</a> by how often they share similar (or identical) words.</p>

<p>For example, it&rsquo;s easy to deduce that <em>introducción</em> (in Spanish) means the same as <em>introducció</em> (in Catalan), or that <em>respuesta</em> and <em>resposta</em> are the same thing.</p>

<p>In fact, when you look at the Spanish and Catalan words next to each other, it seems that the same kinds of transformations crop up again and again: consonants becoming repeated, vowels being dropped off the ends of words, stressed vowels changing in predictable ways, …</p>

<p>Of course, the languages are very different and often use completely distinct words, but it got me thinking: how reliably can we guess a Catalan word from a Spanish one, using just a small set of simple transformations?</p>
