<p></p>

<h1 id="video-compression-how-does-it-work">Video compression – how does it work?</h1>

<p>The short answer is: I don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s never stopped me before so…</p>

<p>A key concept in video encoding is <em>frame types</em>. Each <em>frame</em> (a single image in the video) can either be a <em>key frame</em> or an <em>inter frame</em>. Key frames are easy to understand – they are just a picture, stored as something like a JPEG we&rsquo;re all familiar with.</p>

<p>Inter frames are where things get interesting. The idea is that for the <strong>vast</strong> majority of video content, frame N is pretty similar to frame N-1 (and frame N+1 for that matter). Using this fact, it&rsquo;s possible to store frame N in a <strong>much</strong> more compact way by representing it as a delta on its neighbouring frames. Interestingly, this so-called inter framing is why colours and shapes can appear to erroneously &ldquo;smear&rdquo; over a second or two of video if the video file is damaged or incomplete. The decoder gets confused and can propagate forward corruption from one frame into subsequent frames.</p>

    <span class="caption">In this diagram, the green <strong>I</strong> frames are the key frames. The blue and red <strong>B</strong> and <strong>P</strong> frames are different types of inter frames.</span>
  
</div>



<p>Video encoders support automatic insertion of key frames when they detect a significant delta between two frames – e.g. across scene changes. The thinking here is that if two adjacent frames are quite dissimilar, there&rsquo;s no benefit in calculating delta and using an inter frame: we might as well store the first frame of the new scene as a key frame.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-skipping-video">What does this have to do with skipping video?</h1>

<p>One consequence of this mix of key frames and inter frames in a video is that we have indicators as to when scene change events are happening. The video encoder is using these events internally, to decide between key or inter frames, but I think they also enable a content-aware skip feature.</p>

<p>When we hit the &ldquo;skip forward&rdquo; button, imagine the video jumps ahead to the next key frame – rather than 5 or 10 seconds into the future. If those key frames are aligned with scene changes, you get per-scene skipping basically for free.</p>

<p>Imagine how expensive it would be to have a human manually add cue points to video, demarcating every scene change? For a platform like YouTube – where 400+ hours of video are uploaded every second – this is beyond impossible.</p>

<p>Almost as a side-effect, the video encoding process builds up an understanding of transition points where one frame is very dissimilar to the last – because it wants to insert key frames there. If we save the locations of those key frames as metadata alongside the encoded video, we have everything we need to power a more intelligent skipping feature.</p>

<p>To improve on this, rather than saving just the key frame locations, we could also save the similarity between frames at those points. With that data, the skipping feature could be finer grained (stopping at every single key frame) or coarser grained (only stopping at key frames where a huge delta was detected).</p>

<h1 id="sounds-great-let-s-do-it-why-won-t-it-work">Sounds great, let&rsquo;s do it! Why won&rsquo;t it work?</h1>

<p>A couple of reasons:</p>

<h2 id="sometimes-frames-change-a-lot-during-a-single-scene">Sometimes frames change a lot during a single scene</h2>

<p>For example, suppose the hero steps out into the sunshine. Or there&rsquo;s a massive explosion. Or somebody turns a bedside light on. The examples go on and on where we – as humans – understand there&rsquo;s a contiguous flow to the content, but our poor old video encoder probably thinks that these two frames have very little to do with each other.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps this isn&rsquo;t such a huge problem: the <strong>majority</strong> of scenes do consist of gradually changing frames, so although it&rsquo;s easy to come up with counter examples, in the general case it&rsquo;s still workable<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="most-video-encoders-don-t-use-automatic-key-frame-insertion">Most video encoders don&rsquo;t use automatic key frame insertion</h2>

<p><strong>This</strong> is the real problem. The majority of video that we watch nowadays is a) streamed and b) variable bit rate, and that&rsquo;s <a href="https://video.ibm.com/blog/streaming-video-tips/keyframes-interframe-video-compression/#auto">not a good fit</a> for auto key framing.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with adaptive streaming technology to say <strong>why</strong> it&rsquo;s dependent upon evenly-spaced key frames, but I can tell by instinct it would make things much more straightforward. There certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy way to apply an inter frame at one resolution on top of a key frame at another. For that reason, ensuring that the various steams&rsquo; key frames are in sync – so we can switch between streams at key frame boundaries – seems like a great choice. The even-spacing: I&rsquo;m not so sure why that is important…</p>

<p>Perhaps at some point in the future, dependence on evenly-spaced, in-sync key frames will go away, and we can revisit using the key frame spacing to power user features like this, rather than just as an internal video encoding detail!</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">One interesting point here: what about scenes where the camera is panning? From one frame to another, there could be quite low pixel-by-pixel similarity as everything is shifting left to right. Luckily, modern video encoding also has all sorts of incredibly clever object tracking functionality, so objects moving across the screen – or even the whole shot panning – can be represented in a way which still appears to be a small delta.

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>We&rsquo;ve recently started using You Need A Budget (<a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a>) to plan our finances. Unfortunately, like most finance apps it&rsquo;s focussed squarely on the north american market: its automatic transaction importing only works for some US and Canadian banks – and we live and bank in Spain…</p>

<p>YNAB <strong>does</strong> support a manual process, where you upload QFX or OFX files – or CSVs (in their required format). However, our bank (<a href="https://www.bancsabadell.com">Sabadell</a>) supports neither QFX nor OFX, and their CSV format is markedly different from that which YNAB expects in the upload. We were stuck with the prospect of importing every single transaction by hand, or manually downloading a CSV from Sabadell and munging it into a shape that YNAB can understand.</p>

<p>Surely we can do better?</p>

<p>So became <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/ynabadell"><strong>ynabadell</strong></a> – a tool to automatically import transactions from Sabadell into your YNAB ledger.</p>

<p>Desktop and web-based players alike allow the user to jump forwards or backwards by 5 or 10 seconds, or possibly speed up and slow down playback. These controls operate identically no matter what the user is watching – there&rsquo;s no connection between the <strong>content</strong> of the video, and the controls.</p>

<p>DVDs were the first format I know of that allowed you to skip via <strong>chapters</strong>, but even something as basic as those coarse-grained content-aware controls aren&rsquo;t available in things like YouTube videos today.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for how to identify the salient points in a video that a user might want to skip to: the good news is that this could all be done automatically, and with very little overhead; I&rsquo;ll leave the bad news to the end!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>One of the main reasons InnoDB is the go-to choice for our MySQL tables is that it supports row-level locking<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This means that as we&rsquo;re reading from and writing to a table, we don&rsquo;t need to wait for <strong>all</strong> the other processes to finish up their work before we can get access to that table.</p>

<p>For larger tables, this ability to have multiple processes working on the same table at the same time is almost essential to get any level of decent performance, for most workloads.</p>

<p>However, we recently ran into a problem where – because of a detail of how InnoDB and MySQL work – we ended up doing table-level locking rather than row-level, with disastrous results.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/">a discussion on Reddit</a> concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?</p>

<p>The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but <strong>virulently</strong> so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/dsw9cmk/">only one person</a> whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.</p>

<p>I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate. However, if they&rsquo;re approached in a thoughtful and careful way, they&rsquo;re one of the best tools for effective interviewing. Here&rsquo;s what I think does—and doesn&rsquo;t—work.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I&rsquo;m currently learning Catalan and Spanish, and am reminded every day of the languages&rsquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">shared ancestor</a> by how often they share similar (or identical) words.</p>

<p>For example, it&rsquo;s easy to deduce that <em>introducción</em> (in Spanish) means the same as <em>introducció</em> (in Catalan), or that <em>respuesta</em> and <em>resposta</em> are the same thing.</p>

<p>In fact, when you look at the Spanish and Catalan words next to each other, it seems that the same kinds of transformations crop up again and again: consonants becoming repeated, vowels being dropped off the ends of words, stressed vowels changing in predictable ways, …</p>

<p>Of course, the languages are very different and often use completely distinct words, but it got me thinking: how reliably can we guess a Catalan word from a Spanish one, using just a small set of simple transformations?</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="http://thibault-faverie.com/Cold-Pot">Cold Pot</a> – which pushes air through a dry aluminium sleeve – I&rsquo;m trying to maximise the surface area of wet terracotta which the incoming air passes over before emerging from the exhaust.</p>
