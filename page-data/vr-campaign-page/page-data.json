We all\nthrow suggestions into a melting-pot of ideas in the run-up to the event, with\nthe most promising, most interesting, and most popular suggestions graduating\nto be hacked upon by a small team for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine at\n<a href=\"http://www.dodocase.com/collections/virtual-reality\">DODOcase</a> had given me a\ncouple of Google Cardboard-based virtual reality viewers that I hadn’t gotten\naround to playing with yet, and this hackathon was the perfect opportunity to\nhave a play!</p>\n<p>The basic idea was to use the <a href=\"https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/\">Virtual Reality capabilities in\nWebGL</a> to give a Cardboard-equipped customer\na 3D virtual preview of the product. This is still experimental stuff, but\nwell-supported in all modern mobile browsers!</p>\n<p>In order to prove the idea was even vaguely possible, and to give my Hackathon\npitch some substance, I put together this quick-and-dirty prototype\n(<a href=\"/vr-campaign.xhtml\">full-screen version here</a>):</p>\n<iframe src=\"/vr-campaign.xhtml\" height=\"350px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none\"> </iframe>\n<p>Here, the Cardboard shows the left render to your left eye, and the right\nrender to your right eye. The camera locations are slightly different meaning\nyou get a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy\">stereoscopic</a> effect!</p>\n<p>In the end, I didn’t move the idea past this prototype stage (and ended up\nhacking on machine learning fraud detection instead… more on that another time\nmaybe), but I was surprised by how easy it was to get VR working on my phone\nbrowser, and how well it performed!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Prototype: Virtual Reality e-commerce","description":"A quick and dirty proof of concept for a virtual reality Teespring campaign page, created as a potential hackathon project.","keywords":["tech","virtual reality","ecommerce","shopping","cardboard","google"],"coverImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/vr-campaign-page/"}}}
