I was living in San Francisco\nwith some friends: holed away in the basement, putting in impossibly long\nhours with my co-founders and class mates.</p>\n<p>I’d been back home to the UK briefly a couple of weeks earlier, partly for\nimmigration reasons but mostly to visit my grandpa who was in hospital, dying\nof cancer.</p>\n<p>As usual, I’d made the trip with United Airlines. The lustre of trans-Atlantic\nflights had already faded, and I was building up a strong learned\nassociation between United flights and sore backs, bruised knees, scratchy\ncontact lenses and claustrophobic boredom. Despite that, I had already booked\nmy next flight home for a month’s time with them.</p>\n<p>And so it was, that when I got the call one morning to tell me that grandpa\ndied, I got straight on the phone to United to see if I could move my SFO → LHR\nflight forward for the funeral.</p>\n<p>The lady I spoke to at United was polite but brief. Our run through the\nidentification questions was mechanical and efficient, and in no time we got to\nthe reason I’d called them: I indicated I wanted to bring forward my return\nflight.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“To what date, sir?”, she asked.</p>\n<p>“As soon as possible”, I replied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There was a nanosecond-scale pause here: I think she was more used to people\nneeding to move flights a day or two either way. We pressed on though,\ndiscussing possible flights and routes, and the $300 or so fee for changing the\nflight.</p>\n<p>After the flight details were all sorted but before we moved onto payment, we\nstepped through what seemed to be the standard form for tracking flight\nchanges.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Can I ask why you chose to change your United flight?”, she said.</p>\n<p>“For a funeral. My grandfather died.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I replied with a sickening, hollow pang in my gut. The same pang I feel writing\nabout it, except multiplied a hundredfold. A noticeable pause here, and then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Excuse me for a moment sir, can I put you on hold?“.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t mind being put on hold; in fact I was grateful, as the canned hold\nmusic flicked a switch in my brain, and I automatically began to daydream about\ninconsequential things, rather than dwell on what the next few days had in\nstore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That’s all arranged now, sir. You’re booked on United flight 930 from SFO to\nLondon Heathrow tomorrow”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pleased to be off the phone, I went back to work, packed that evening and\nheaded to the airport the following day.</p>\n<p>I think it was only when I’d dropped my bags at check-in that I realised I’d\nnever actually paid for my flight change. Initially, I felt a little smug,\nactually: there’d been an oversight and I’d managed to get something for free!</p>\n<p>But, sat on the plane with all the time in the world to ponder, I started to\nthink about what had happened on the phone with United. Had it really been an\noversight? That pause after I mentioned the funeral, then being put on hold…\nThe breezy voice the lady had used when coming back on the phone…</p>\n<p>Perhaps the customer service agent had had a death in the family recently?</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s standard United policy to make special dispensation for customers\nin such situations?</p>\n<p>Or perhaps it was all unofficial and someone somewhere is still puzzling over\n$300 missing on a balance sheet. I hope not.</p>\n<p>I still think about this from time to time, and have come to realise that this\nsort of treatment doesn’t happen automatically in a company. Either there was\nan official escalation channel which meant a flight change can be comped within\n30 seconds, or the agent I was speaking to was given some discretion to do this\nwhen she saw fit.</p>\n<p>Air travel is a fiercely competitive industry, and I wouldn’t have been at all\nsurprised if – to keep costs down – there had been absolutely no wiggle room\non that flight change fee. After all, 2008 was the year of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Breaks_Guitars\">infamous\nuncompensated guitar\nbreaking</a>. It strikes me as\nan extremely enlightened policy to have some flexibility for special treatment in\ncases of bereavement.</p>\n<p>Whatever it was that meant this lady was willing and able to give me a break\nand change my flight for free, it’s won United Airlines a lifelong customer in\nme.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How a death won a lifelong customer","description":null,"keywords":null,"coverImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-a-death-won-a-lifelong-customer/"}}}
