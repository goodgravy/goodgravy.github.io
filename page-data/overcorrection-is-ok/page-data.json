He warns against overreaction and moral panic almost as much as he condemns the injustices that trigger our reaction.</p>\n<p>In 2018, his conversation with Rebecca Traister – <a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcasts/141-metoo-going-far/\">Is #MeToo Going Too Far</a> – provoked a similar response. In that podcast, they discussed cases like that of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/matt-damon-hollywood-reckoning-apology\">Matt Damon getting blowback</a> from his comments calling for a recognition of a spectrum of transgression.</p>\n<p>As Rebecca said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what happened to Matt Damon is that people were mean to him on the Internet […] I think people were angry because it was a sort of condescending misreading of the actual very nuanced and complicated conversation that was taking place</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure that at the time it felt very unpleasant for Matt Damon to become a target for such anger – leading to him retracting the statements and “getting in the backseat” as he said. However, as Rebecca predicted then, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/\">his career hasn’t suffered at all</a>.</p>\n<p>To Sam, the outcry seemed to be an unfortunate overreaction. To me, that seems fine: good, in fact. A public figure made poorly-considered and insensitive comments, got some flak, took them back, said sorry, and everything carried on. Perhaps there was some overreaction at the time – understandably, given many people extremely angry – but the actor’s error was corrected quickly and there was no lasting damage.</p>\n<p>Although we’re still too early in the current Black Lives Matter protests to know how things will play out, I think the same principle applies here. I’m not pro-looting, of course, but I think we need to give the protesters on the streets some leeway because in the end <strong>it will result in a quicker arrival at a better society</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asymptotes-and-intersections\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#asymptotes-and-intersections\" aria-label=\"asymptotes and intersections permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Asymptotes and intersections</h2>\n<p>Let’s say there is a mythical “100% perfect” society that we’re aiming for.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/567ac/asymptotic.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 34.96932515337423%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAYAAAAIy204AAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA4UlEQVQoz2VSS64DIQyb+1+z3XTeqvwCAeIaKlTEi2QlYWLjoLmcc4gxorUGVYXWChcVb8InheQKP2tmWWgIucGxDpzxXuBDRiCuIdR7RzeDWUfMHUX7rGsziBqUuVb2RSc0RNQQoJ4Ymf33LOKqdDRER2g18MJfdJ5rgaUIkzSBLMCYp4mZaWSPK/AGEZlNKEYNuisZnc/QE0VyhpFoG9G2bHOzH641JOO93hEYbihow8EyepCW+FljCaoUiKNQq9gXsGMdHN/+CY6VT+I5GGLC4/nE333jfr1mPf6GnbfzP2pkJ15//2okAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"asymptotic\"\n        title=\"asymptotic\"\n        src=\"/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/a6d36/asymptotic.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/222b7/asymptotic.png 163w,\n/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/ff46a/asymptotic.png 325w,\n/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/a6d36/asymptotic.png 650w,\n/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/e548f/asymptotic.png 975w,\n/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/3c492/asymptotic.png 1300w,\n/static/1de995c3cdc045238a92a85b4441d48f/567ac/asymptotic.png 1675w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If we aim for that perfect society, moving deliberately forward through a series of rational conversations and subsequent adjustments, we will make progress – that’s not in doubt – but our movement towards perfection will never quite get us there (red line).</p>\n<p>If instead, we allow for some over-correction and resets (blue line), then we converge on where we want to be much faster.
