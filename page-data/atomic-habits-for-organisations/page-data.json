Partially-deprecated services, contorted logic, misleading comments, duplicated functionality, flaky tests, non-idiomatic patterns, … the usual.</p>\n<p>We already do pretty well at tackling big projects which structurally address tech debt. When we work on any significant project, we naturally have a discussion about the best way to implement the change in such a way as to avoid problematic areas, leave things cleaner than we found them, and deprecate and remove legacy code.</p>\n<p>However, we were failing on a smaller scale.</p>\n<p>The progress we made in big sweeping refactors and replacement projects was <em>partially</em> undone by pernicious little slivers of tech debt creeping in with every change we made. Shamefully, my approach before was basically to ask the team to “try harder” not to introduce tech debt. Try harder they did, but we needed a better approach. We needed something that became a core part of our engineering culture, rather than something that people had to put effort in to remember to do.</p>\n<p>So, we came up with a new habit to instill within the engineering team working on our most problematic codebase.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In every pull request you should address a specific piece of tech debt and call it out in the PR description.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-habit-loop\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-habit-loop\" aria-label=\"the habit loop permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The habit loop</h2>\n<h5 id=\"1-make-it-obvious\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#1-make-it-obvious\" aria-label=\"1 make it obvious permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1.

Make it attractive</h5>\n<p>This was easy. In some companies, I’ve seen tech debt clean-up viewed with apathy and dismay. Not so at Teespring.</p>\n<p>I think partly because we feel the needling of tech debt every time we make a change, and partly because we have a fantastic team, everyone is ready, able, and excited to solve the challenge of tech debt: it was innately attractive.</p>\n<h5 id=\"3-make-it-easy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-make-it-easy\" aria-label=\"3 make it easy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3.

This removed all barriers for a PR author to identify something they could usefully do to meet the criteria.</p>\n<p>The emphasis here was that the <strong>amount</strong> or <strong>complexity</strong> of the tech debt was irrelevant.
