The obvious problem here is that the deadline is 30 years in the future: I think we really some checkpoints along the way.</p>\n<p>Labour’s pledges were a little harder to parse as their manifesto was infamously sprawling.

However, at the same time the death rate for certain emergency admissions spiked.</p>\n<p>Separately, data from both <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157223\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/58/5/1212/4827589\">London</a> show that increasing stop-and-search police activity increases arrest rate significantly. However, it doesn’t appear to have any significant effect on actual crime rate.</p>\n<p>When assessed with one set of metrics, both schemes were a great success. Taking knives off the streets via more arrests sounds positive! Decreased waiting times sounds great! But would the racially-profiled young black man in New York agree? How about the bereaved family of a heart-attack victim in the UK?</p>\n<p>In both cases, the government can tout the upsides of their projects by cherry-picking which metrics to brief on, after the fact. In both cases, the schemes were – holistically – failures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-could-we-do-differently\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-could-we-do-differently\" aria-label=\"what could we do differently permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What could we do differently?</h2>\n<p>Politicians obviously do consider what people think is important when formulating their policies and drawing up manifestos. Huge industries exist to poll people across a spectrum of issues and deliver insights to the policy-makers, broken down by demographics.</p>\n<p>Rather than private polling firms gauging interest in the completion of this or that project, consider a system where we make a <strong>transparent</strong> communal assessment of how highly we rate certain metrics. Each metric would be precisely defined, the body responsible for measuring it would be named, and their methodology would be shared.</p>\n<p>It would be like a national referendum on priorities.</p>\n<p>The political parties would all have access to these data, and then be responsible for drawing up a plan for how they would address the people’s priorities: or, realistically, the subset of the priorities most popular with their core voters.</p>\n<p>This would have several beneficial effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It would force the political parties to tie their policies directly to the outcomes they are trying to achieve. It would discourage flowery language which sounds nice, but doesn’t actually add up to much.</li>\n<li>Throughout a political term, we would have constant feedback on how the party is doing, as measured by the metrics most important to the populus.</li>\n<li>It would highlight misalignment between the stated priorities of the electorate, and the allocation of resources in the budget.</li>\n<li>Those in power would be disincentivised from plowing forward with projects which don’t actually make sense: the cost of political U-turns would be decreased and therefore we would become more flexible and adaptable.</li>\n<li>Voters could more easily choose between parties based on how well their goals are aligned, rather than following the inertia of the last general election, or based on superficial attributes of the politicians themselves.</li>\n<li>Towards the end of a political term, the party in power would find it much harder to hide behind carefully selected successful projects, or cherry-picked metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, it would engender an atmosphere of discussion of the priorities and issues, rather than the polarised partisanship which has prevailed over the last ten years.</p>\n\n      <div class=\"footnotes\">\n        <hr/>\n        <ol >\n    \n    <li class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"fn-1\" >\n          \n        <p class=\"footnote-paragraph\" style=\"display:inline; \">From the <em>Green Industrial Revolution</em> section of <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/manifesto-2019/a-green-industrial-revolution\">Labour’s 2019 manifesto</a>:</p>\n      <a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" style=\"display:inline;\">\n        ↟\n      </a>\n    \n      </li>\n      \n    </ol></div>\n<ul>\n<li>create one million jobs in the UK</li>\n<li>create a Sustainable Investment Board</li>\n<li>launch a National Transformation Fund of £400 billion</li>\n<li>National Investment Bank, backed up by a network of Regional Development Banks, to provide £250 billion</li>\n<li>bring about a radical decentralisation of power</li>\n<li>deliver nearly 90% of electricity and 50% of heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030</li>\n<li>7,000 new offshore wind turbines</li>\n<li>2,000 new onshore wind turbines</li>\n<li>Enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches.</li>\n<li>New nuclear power needed for energy security.</li>\n<li>upgrade almost all of the UK’s 27 million homes to the highest energy-efficiency standards</li>\n<li>roll out technologies like heat pumps, solar hot water and hydrogen</li>\n<li>expand power storage and invest in grid enhancements and interconnectors</li>\n<li>expand distributed and community energy</li>\n<li>immediately and permanently ban fracking</li>\n<li>introduce a windfall tax on oil companies</li>\n<li>bringing our energy and water systems into democratic public ownership</li>\n<li>A new UK National Energy Agency will own and maintain the national grid infrastructure and oversee the delivery of our decarbonisation targets.</li>\n<li>14 new Regional Energy Agencies will replace the existing district network operators and hold statutory responsibility for decarbonising electricity and heat and reducing fuel poverty.</li>\n<li>The supply arms of the Big Six energy companies will be brought into public ownership where they will continue to supply households with energy while helping them to reduce their energy demands.</li>\n<li>Whenever public money is invested in an energy generation project, the public sector will take a stake and return profits to the public.</li>\n<li>instruct the Committee on Climate Change to assess the emissions the UK imports as well as those it produces</li>\n<li>create an innovation nation, setting a target for 3% of GDP to be spent on research and development (R&#x26;D) by 2030</li>\n<li>establish a Foundation Industries Sector Council</li>\n<li>investing in three new gigafactories and four metal reprocessing plants</li>\n<li>uphold the highest environmental and social regulations in all our trade relations, and will never downgrade standards as ‘barriers’ to trade</li>\n<li>review public expenditure on transport to ensure that it promotes environmental sustainability</li>\n<li>Labour will introduce free bus travel for under-25s</li>\n<li>increase and expand local services, reinstating the 3,000 routes that have been cut</li>\n<li>bringing our railways back into public ownership</li>\n<li>implement a full, rolling programme of electrification</li>\n<li>introduce a long-term investment plan including delivering Crossrail for the North</li>\n<li>extend high-speed rail networks nationwide by completing the full HS2 route to Scotland</li>\n<li>create towns and cities in which walking and cycling are the best choice</li>\n<li>The Conservatives have committed to ending new sales of combustion engine vehicles by 2040.
