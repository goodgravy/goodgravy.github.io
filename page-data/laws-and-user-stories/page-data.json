It must be one of the most divisive and problematic sentences ever written:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’m no constitutional scholar, and my views on gun ownership aren’t important here: what matters is that this sentence is at the core of a bitter, widening rift, and has been been for decades.
