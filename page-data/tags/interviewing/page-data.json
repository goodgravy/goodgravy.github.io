It basically boiled down to: Is it acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview? The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but virulently so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was only one person whose opinion wasn’t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.","fields":{"slug":"/take-home-tests/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 24, 2018","title":"Take Home Tests","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4883720930232558,"src":"/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/07af2/blake-connally-373084.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/684c4/blake-connally-373084.jpg 64w,\n/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/6d25d/blake-connally-373084.jpg 128w,\n/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/07af2/blake-connally-373084.jpg 256w,\n/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/57dc6/blake-connally-373084.jpg 384w,\n/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/49b36/blake-connally-373084.jpg 512w,\n/static/f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672/947df/blake-connally-373084.jpg 5472w","sizes":"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"}}},"staticThumbnail":null}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"At the moment – and for the foreseeable future – the power balance of hiring\nnegotiations favours the engineering candidates rather than with the hiring\ncompany.
