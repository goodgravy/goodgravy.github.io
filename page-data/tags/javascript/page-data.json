Unfortunately, like most finance apps it’s focussed squarely on the north american market: its automatic transaction importing only works for some US and Canadian banks – and we live and bank in Spain… YNAB does support a manual process, where you upload QFX or OFX files – or CSVs (in their required format). However, our bank (Sabadell) supports neither QFX nor OFX, and their CSV format is markedly different from that which YNAB expects in the upload. We were stuck with the prospect of importing every single transaction by hand, or manually downloading a CSV from Sabadell and munging it into a shape that YNAB can understand. Surely we can do better?","fields":{"slug":"/ynabadell/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 04, 2019","title":"ynabadell: connect your Sabadell bank account with YNAB","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.2549019607843137,"src":"/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/07af2/calculator.jpg","srcSet":"/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/684c4/calculator.jpg 64w,\n/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/6d25d/calculator.jpg 128w,\n/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/07af2/calculator.jpg 256w,\n/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/57dc6/calculator.jpg 384w,\n/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/49b36/calculator.jpg 512w,\n/static/12106c15c2aea68583340c3779969f92/ea7dd/calculator.jpg 2500w","sizes":"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"}}},"staticThumbnail":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"javascript"}}}
