              <p>I was always told to prize gifts that people had put time and effort into.
Hoping my SO shared the same view, I decided to make her a little something for
her birthday.</p>

<p>Being creatively barren, I attempted plagiarism. I remembered seeing <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leafcutterdesigns/retro-punch-boxes-for-valentines-day">this
Kickstarter
project</a>
ages ago. It&rsquo;s based on an old parlour game: the idea is to conceal little
messages inside a nice-looking block, to be popped out with a pencil when the
recipient feels like it.
</p>

<p>Now, that Kickstarter project is long since finished but I reckoned I could
have a pretty good go at making my own version. Here&rsquo;s what I ended up with so
you can decide whether to keep reading or not:</p>

<p>I know, it looks like shit doesn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t worry: they&rsquo;ll be blown away that
you made the effort &#x1f44c;.</p>

<h1 id="what-you-ll-need">What you&rsquo;ll need</h1>

<ul>
<li>three blocks of wood (I used 150mm × 150mm × 20mm, but up to you)</li>
<li>crêpe paper</li>
<li>two pieces of thick, patterned paper (same size as the faces of the blocks,
e.g. 150mm × 150mm in my case)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cutetape.com/">washi tape</a></li>
<li>glue (I used 3M spray mount)</li>
<li>writing paper</li>
<li>a drill and ~5mm bit (<em>ideally</em> a drill press but not absolutely required)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-we-re-aiming-for">What we&rsquo;re aiming for</h1>

<p>The structure of the block itself is really simple: it&rsquo;s just a square-ish cut
of wood with holes drilled through. Rolled up notes are inserted into these
cylindrical holes, and we stick crêpe paper on both faces to hold them in
place.</p>

<p>To make the object a bit more appealing, we&rsquo;ll add some patterned paper to the
top and bottom of the block, with holes pre-punched in it. This makes it easy
to see where the notes are hiding, and hence where the recipient should poke a
pencil to get one out.</p>

<p>Lastly, we&rsquo;ll use washi tape &ndash; basically patterned sticky tape &ndash; around the
edge, to keep the crêpe nice and tidy.</p>

<p>This shows a cross-section of the completed box:</p>

<h1 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h1>

<h2 id="creating-the-rolled-up-notes">Creating the rolled up notes</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cut the writing paper into strips</strong>. I found that 210mm long strips (the
width of A4 paper) can be rolled up to fit in a 5mm hole. They should be a
couple of millimeters narrower than the wood; e.g. with 20mm thick wood, cut
18mm wide strips.</li>
<li><strong>Write your notes on the paper strips</strong>. I can&rsquo;t really help with this bit!</li>
<li><strong>Roll the notes up into tight spirals</strong>. I set it up so that as they were
unrolled, the message gradually appeared as written.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="preparing-the-wood-and-patterned-paper-what-we-re-aiming-for-here-is-a-wood">Preparing the wood and patterned paper What we&rsquo;re aiming for here is a wood</h2>

<p>block with holes drilled in it, and patterned paper with holes in it that
exactly match the layout of holes in the wood block.</p>

<p>To do that, we&rsquo;ll sandwich the wood and paper together (using two sacrificial
wood blocks to prevent tear-out) and drill holes in the wood block <em>and</em>
patterned paper at the same time. This guarantees the holes in your paper will
line up with the holes in the block.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cut out pieces of your patterned paper</strong>. The pieces should be just big
enough to cover the two largest faces of the block. Mark the paper and
blocks to remember which one goes on which side.</li>
<li><strong>Layer your wood blocks and patterned paper</strong>. Wood block, patterned paper,
wood block, patterned paper, wood block (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Clamp the wood and paper</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Drill holes through the whole lot</strong>. This is where a drill press would be
really handy. If you don&rsquo;t have one, make sure your drilling at a
perpendicular!</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the wood-paper sandwich looks before and after drilling:</p>

    <span class="caption">Cross-section before drilling</span>
  
</div>



<h2 id="inserting-the-notes">Inserting the notes</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Glue crêpe on the bottom of the wood block</strong>. Apply glue to the wood
rather than the crêpe, so that you don&rsquo;t glue the crêpe to the notes
accidentally. Don&rsquo;t use too much glue because excess will easily soak
through the paper!</li>
<li><strong>Insert rolled notes into the holes in your wood</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Glue crêpe on the top of the wood block</strong>. Again, apply glue to the wood
rather than the crêpe.</li>
<li><strong>Stick washi tape round the edge of the block</strong>. A sharp knife makes it
easier to get the ends of the tape to sit close to each other without
overlapping.</li>
<li><strong>Stick patterned paper on the top and bottom of the block</strong>. Use the marks
you made to ensure you have the right piece of paper, in the right
orientation, on the right face.</li>
<li><strong>Leave to dry</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To ensure that there wasn&rsquo;t an unsightly crêpe paper join at the edges of the
box, I cut the bottom piece of paper too big and wrapped the excess up and
around the sides of the box. That way the top piece of crêpe met and overlapped
with the bottom piece.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>We&rsquo;ve recently started using You Need A Budget (<a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a>) to plan our finances. Unfortunately, like most finance apps it&rsquo;s focussed squarely on the north american market: its automatic transaction importing only works for some US and Canadian banks – and we live and bank in Spain…</p>

<p>YNAB <strong>does</strong> support a manual process, where you upload QFX or OFX files – or CSVs (in their required format). However, our bank (<a href="https://www.bancsabadell.com">Sabadell</a>) supports neither QFX nor OFX, and their CSV format is markedly different from that which YNAB expects in the upload. We were stuck with the prospect of importing every single transaction by hand, or manually downloading a CSV from Sabadell and munging it into a shape that YNAB can understand.</p>

<p>Surely we can do better?</p>

<p>So became <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/ynabadell"><strong>ynabadell</strong></a> – a tool to automatically import transactions from Sabadell into your YNAB ledger.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Don&rsquo;t video player controls seem dumb?</p>

<p>Desktop and web-based players alike allow the user to jump forwards or backwards by 5 or 10 seconds, or possibly speed up and slow down playback. These controls operate identically no matter what the user is watching – there&rsquo;s no connection between the <strong>content</strong> of the video, and the controls.</p>

<p>DVDs were the first format I know of that allowed you to skip via <strong>chapters</strong>, but even something as basic as those coarse-grained content-aware controls aren&rsquo;t available in things like YouTube videos today.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for how to identify the salient points in a video that a user might want to skip to: the good news is that this could all be done automatically, and with very little overhead; I&rsquo;ll leave the bad news to the end!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>One of the main reasons InnoDB is the go-to choice for our MySQL tables is that it supports row-level locking<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This means that as we&rsquo;re reading from and writing to a table, we don&rsquo;t need to wait for <strong>all</strong> the other processes to finish up their work before we can get access to that table.</p>

<p>For larger tables, this ability to have multiple processes working on the same table at the same time is almost essential to get any level of decent performance, for most workloads.</p>

<p>However, we recently ran into a problem where – because of a detail of how InnoDB and MySQL work – we ended up doing table-level locking rather than row-level, with disastrous results.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/">a discussion on Reddit</a> concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?</p>

<p>The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but <strong>virulently</strong> so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/dsw9cmk/">only one person</a> whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.</p>

<p>I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate. However, if they&rsquo;re approached in a thoughtful and careful way, they&rsquo;re one of the best tools for effective interviewing. Here&rsquo;s what I think does—and doesn&rsquo;t—work.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I&rsquo;m currently learning Catalan and Spanish, and am reminded every day of the languages&rsquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">shared ancestor</a> by how often they share similar (or identical) words.</p>

<p>For example, it&rsquo;s easy to deduce that <em>introducción</em> (in Spanish) means the same as <em>introducció</em> (in Catalan), or that <em>respuesta</em> and <em>resposta</em> are the same thing.</p>

<p>In fact, when you look at the Spanish and Catalan words next to each other, it seems that the same kinds of transformations crop up again and again: consonants becoming repeated, vowels being dropped off the ends of words, stressed vowels changing in predictable ways, …</p>

<p>Of course, the languages are very different and often use completely distinct words, but it got me thinking: how reliably can we guess a Catalan word from a Spanish one, using just a small set of simple transformations?</p>

When working correctly, the code under test takes a URL something like this:
