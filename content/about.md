I am an engineer at [Teespring](https://teespring.com). I like Ruby, Elixir, hard problems and learning new things with which solve them.

I am fascinated by frisbees to the point of it getting a bit weird.

I like going to Burning Man, although I feel like I've grown out of it a bit. Instead I am embracing my middle-ages with a new-found love for woodworking.

I live in a teeny tiny village in [Catalunya](https://www.google.com/maps/place/08518+Orist%C3%A0,+Barcelona/@41.9332376,2.0584424,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a51dd0dec0e009:0xdc76ab2b1f5e82fd!8m2!3d41.9325408!4d2.060086?hl=en), and I'm learning to speak Catalan.

I am mostly vegetarian.

That is all.
