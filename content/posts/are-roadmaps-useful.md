Does anyone actually do product roadmaps any more? If so: how? And why?

At university, we were given the launch of a space shuttle as a classic example of where iterative software development wouldn't work, and waterfull reigned supreme: there's no such thing as an MVP and you don't really get to do a bug fix update if your V1 didn't work. But today, even [NASA is doing Agile](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120013429.pdf). What should a medium- and long-term plan look like in this context?

<!-- excerpt -->

Historically, at Teespring we have tried to layout out a grand plan for what each quarter would look like. Sometimes this has gotten as detailed as what each individual engineer on a particular team would be working on on a week-by-week basis, over a full three month period.

Ignoring for a moment the obvious futility of trying to predict with any confidence that level of detail at that distance, the more pernicious problem is that these roadmaps would almost immediately become a burden rather than a useful tool.

There would be high friction to considering new projects ("what will we take out of the plan to make room?"), and low friction to plowing on with the planned work even if it wasn't the most impactful thing the team could do.

On top of that, the quarterly planning processing was antithetical to any sort of iterative, explorative experimentation. We had to get stuff locked in for the start of the quarter so there were a lot of implicit assumptions that we had neither a culture nor a process to validate.

### Out with the old; in with the new

[Sense & Respond](https://senseandrespond.co/) is a great reference here. It emphasises the importance of tight feedback loops in the way a company functions, and of bringing people from different disciplines together to make smaller decisions faster.

Inspired by that, here is the approach we will follow for Q3:
1. The commercial leads and data team build a bottom-up model of what we should expect our baseline business performance to be
1. We form a number of **cross-functional teams** each defined around an area of the business
1. Using our overall vision and strategy, the executive team identify the main execution and stategic outcomes we want to achieve
1. We turn these outcomes into measurable KPIs[^1] applicable to each of the cross-functional teams
1. The cross-functional teams work together to generate:
   * a prioritised list of projects they can tackle to move their allotted KPIs
   * a list of resources (people, marketing budget, etc.) required to successfully execute the projects
1. The executive team lend a critical eye and give feedback on these projects
1. Throughout the quarter we re-examine the projects on a weekly or bi-weekly basis:
   * new opportunities are slotted into the right place
   * if an experiment has disabused us of the potential of a project, we remove it from the list
   * if an idea shows more promise than expected, it's moved up in priority

The most significant step here is actually #7. We could follow any process we wanted to come up with a roughed-out sketch for upcoming work, but the constant re-examination of priorities is where the feedback loop is closed, and where we bake flexibility into the process.

### Risks
A few other situations are often raised as reasons why a strict roadmap is necessary. These include:
- We need to plan and coordinate our marketing efforts with the launch date
- We have external partners depending on something which we've promised
- There's something intrinsic in the work that means it has to be done by X date (e.g. Black Friday readiness)

There will be exceptions, but I believe that even in these cases an iterative, flexible approach will stand a team in good stead. It's not as if in the days of roadmaps there weren't any missed deadlines: we don't have to be perfect in order to be better.

In the case of a big launch, a couple of thoughts. Firstly, the marketing folks should 100% be included in these cross-functional teams so that they're developing and shaping their materials as the product takes shape. They will also build a good set of heuristics for what can be marketed at what points. Secondly, modern marketing is much less about big ad campaigns that need to be planned months in advance. The sectors has itself become much more flexible and dynamic, making it a much better fit for an iterative go-to-market plan.

In the case of external partners, setting up the relationship such as to make it clear your priority is to get a functional MVP up as a sort of proof-of-integration can bring partners in to your development process and build ongoing iterative collaboration between the teams. That's not going to be possible in all cases, but even if you're working with a big unwieldly company, you can focus on delivering incremental value and proving out parts of the integration iteratively. Doing so means that we can confidently answer the "is this partnership working?" question we should regularly be asking ourselves.

Lastly, some work is indeed intrinsically linked to a date in the calendar. In this case, there can still be twists, turns, and changes throughout the duration of the project. "Readiness for Black Friday" could mean something quite different at the start of the quarter versus at the end, and it's only by establishing regular sanity-checking check-ins that we can ensure that the work
