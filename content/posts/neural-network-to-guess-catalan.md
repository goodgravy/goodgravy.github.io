As a follow-up to [_It it possible to guess Catalan words?_](../../08/it-it-possible-to-guess-catalan-words/), how could we use a neural network to solve this problem?

Specifically, suppose there are some transformations we might apply to words in one language in order to na√Øvely translate them into another language. Can a neural network learn which transformations to apply in which scenarios? Could it even learn brand new transformations to apply?

It's not immediately clear how to express this problem as something which could be ingested by a neural network.
