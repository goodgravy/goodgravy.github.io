In April 2008, I'd just finished an arduous [Y
Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) cycle. I was living in San Francisco
with some friends: holed away in the basement, putting in impossibly long
hours with my co-founders and class mates.

I'd been back home to the UK briefly a couple of weeks earlier, partly for
immigration reasons but mostly to visit my grandpa who was in hospital, dying
of cancer.

As usual, I'd made the trip with United Airlines. The lustre of trans-Atlantic
flights had already faded, and I was building up a strong learned
association between United flights and sore backs, bruised knees, scratchy
contact lenses and claustrophobic boredom. Despite that, I had already booked
my next flight home for a month's time with them.

And so it was, that when I got the call one morning to tell me that grandpa
died, I got straight on the phone to United to see if I could move my SFO → LHR
flight forward for the funeral.

The lady I spoke to at United was polite but brief. Our run through the
identification questions was mechanical and efficient, and in no time we got to
the reason I'd called them: I indicated I wanted to bring forward my return
flight.

> "To what date, sir?", she asked.
>
> "As soon as possible", I replied.

There was a nanosecond-scale pause here: I think she was more used to people
needing to move flights a day or two either way. We pressed on though,
discussing possible flights and routes, and the $300 or so fee for changing the
flight.

After the flight details were all sorted but before we moved onto payment, we
stepped through what seemed to be the standard form for tracking flight
changes.

> "Can I ask why you chose to change your United flight?", she said.
>
> "For a funeral. My grandfather died."

I replied with a sickening, hollow pang in my gut. The same pang I feel writing
about it, except multiplied a hundredfold. A noticeable pause here, and then:

> "Excuse me for a moment sir, can I put you on hold?".

I didn't mind being put on hold; in fact I was grateful, as the canned hold
music flicked a switch in my brain, and I automatically began to daydream about
inconsequential things, rather than dwell on what the next few days had in
store.

> "That's all arranged now, sir. You're booked on United flight 930 from SFO to
London Heathrow tomorrow".

Pleased to be off the phone, I went back to work, packed that evening and
headed to the airport the following day.

I think it was only when I'd dropped my bags at check-in that I realised I'd
never actually paid for my flight change. Initially, I felt a little smug,
actually: there'd been an oversight and I'd managed to get something for free!

But, sat on the plane with all the time in the world to ponder, I started to
think about what had happened on the phone with United. Had it really been an
oversight? That pause after I mentioned the funeral, then being put on hold...
The breezy voice the lady had used when coming back on the phone...

Perhaps the customer service agent had had a death in the family recently?

Maybe it's standard United policy to make special dispensation for customers
in such situations?

Or perhaps it was all unofficial and someone somewhere is still puzzling over
$300 missing on a balance sheet. I hope not.

I still think about this from time to time, and have come to realise that this
sort of treatment doesn't happen automatically in a company. Either there was
an official escalation channel which meant a flight change can be comped within
30 seconds, or the agent I was speaking to was given some discretion to do this
when she saw fit.

Air travel is a fiercely competitive industry, and I wouldn't have been at all
surprised if – to keep costs down – there had been absolutely no wiggle room
on that flight change fee. After all, 2008 was the year of the [infamous
uncompensated guitar
breaking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Breaks_Guitars). It strikes me as
an extremely enlightened policy to have some flexibility for special treatment in
cases of bereavement.

Whatever it was that meant this lady was willing and able to give me a break
and change my flight for free, it's won United Airlines a lifelong customer in
me.
