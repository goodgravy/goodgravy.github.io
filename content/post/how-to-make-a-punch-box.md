I was always told to prize gifts that people had put time and effort into.
Hoping my SO shared the same view, I decided to make her a little something for
her birthday.

Being creatively barren, I attempted plagiarism. I remembered seeing [this
Kickstarter
project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leafcutterdesigns/retro-punch-boxes-for-valentines-day)
ages ago. It's based on an old parlour game: the idea is to conceal little
messages inside a nice-looking block, to be popped out with a pencil when the
recipient feels like it.

Now, that Kickstarter project is long since finished, but I reckoned I could
have a pretty good go at making my own version. Here's what I ended up with so
you can decide whether to keep reading or not:

I know, it looks like shit doesn't it? Don't worry: they'll be blown away that
you made the effort &#x1f44c;.

# What you'll need

* three blocks of wood (I used 150mm × 150mm × 20mm, but up to you)
* crêpe paper
* two pieces of thick, patterned paper (same size as the faces of the blocks)
* washi tape (e.g. [like this](http://www.cutetape.com/))
* glue (I used 3M spray mount)
* writing paper
* a drill and ~5mm bit (_ideally_ a drill press but not absolutely required)

# What we're aiming for

The structure of the block itself is really simple: it's just a square-ish cut
of wood with holes drilled through. Rolled up notes are inserted into these
cylindrical holes, and we use crêpe paper on both sides to secure them.

To make the object a bit more appealing, we'll add some patterned paper to
the top and bottom of the block, with holes pre-punched in it. This makes it
easy to see where the holes are (with notes hiding inside!) and where the
recipient should poke a pencil to get one out.

Lastly, we'll use washi tape -- basically patterned sticky tape -- around the
edge, to keep the crêpe nice and tidy.

This shows a cross-section of the completed box:

# How to do it

1. **Cut paper strips for the notes**. I found 210mm long strips (the width of
A4 paper) can be rolled up to fit in a 5mm hole. They should be a couple of
millimeters narrower than the wood; e.g. with 20mm thick wood, cut 18mm wide
strips.
1. **Write your notes on the paper strips**. I can't really help with this bit!
1. **Roll the notes up into tight spirals**. I set it up so that as they were
unrolled, the message gradually appeared as written.
1. **Layer your wood blocks and patterned paper**. The idea here is to place teh 
1. **Drill holes through the wood block**.
1. **Sand the block to round corners and clean up splinters**.
1. **Cut pieces of your patterned paper**. The pieces should be just big enough
to just cover two largest faces of the block.
1. **Mark where we will punch holes in the patterned paper**. See notes below
for the best way to do this.
1. **Glue crêpe on the bottom**. Apply glue to the wood rather than the crêpe,
so that you don't glue the crêpe to the notes accidentally. Don't use too much
glue because excess will easily soak through the paper!
1. **Insert rolled notes into the holes**.
1. **Glue crêpe on the top**. Again, apply glue to the wood rather than the
crêpe.
1. **Stick washi tape round the edge**. A sharp knife makes it easier to get
the ends of the tape to sit close to each other without overlapping.
1. **Punch holes in the patterned paper**. See below for the best way to do
this.
1. **Stick patterned paper on the top and bottom of the block**.
1. **Leave to dry**.

To ensure that there wasn't an unsightly crêpe paper join at the edges of the
box, I cut the bottom piece of paper too big and wrapped the excess up and
around the sides of the box. That way the top piece of crêpe met and overlapped
with the bottom piece.
