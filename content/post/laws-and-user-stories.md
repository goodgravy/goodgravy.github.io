There was a flurry of activity a few years ago when several European countries
pushed towards greater transparency, machine-readability, and accessibility of
their laws and statutes. Germany has Markdown-formatted versions of all their
federal laws [on GitHub](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze), while the
Netherlands went a step further to [develop a
system](https://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/tag/rdf-and-legal-metadata/) that
facilitates legislative drafting, revising, and canonical concept naming with
Cornell.

However laudable I think these projects and ideas are, there is a more fundamental limitation with how we specify, interpret, and update our nations' laws.

The problem is best exemplified by the Second Amendment to the US Constitution. It must be one of the most divisive and problematic sentences ever written:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

I'm no constitutional scholar, and my views on gun ownership aren't important here: what matters is that this sentence is at the core of a bitter, widening rift, and has been been for decades. But why?

# Requirements, not implementation
