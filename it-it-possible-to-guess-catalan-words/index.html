<p></p>

<p>Well, tl;dr, you can make surprisingly informed guesses with very few rules!</p>

<p>I put together a little test in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> (which you <strong>have</strong> to try if you&rsquo;ve not already – I love it) to see which of these word transformations are more or less useful in guessing a Catalan word from a Spanish one.</p>

    <span class="caption">Efficacy of different Spanish to Catalan transformations</span>
  
</div>



<p>The two series represent the two data sources I was working with: <a href="https://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Catal%C3%A1n/Diccionario_castellano-catal%C3%A1n">Wikibooks</a> and this <a href="http://cit.iec.cat/LMC/default.asp?opcio=0">lexicon of construction terminology</a>. Please excuse the an&#230;mic and peculiar data sources: it was nigh on impossible to find a good mapping from Spanish words to Catalan, or vice versa. More on that later.</p>

<h2 id="transformations">Transformations</h2>

<p>In the &ldquo;No translation&rdquo; base case (applying no transformations whatsoever), we can see that somewhere around 10–12% of Spanish words are already exactly equivalent to their Catalan counterparts (depending on data set).</p>

<p>I then applied <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/translate/blob/c5ea1dc90a709cd5dbfa77d1f39a03c818ee536f/lib/translate/transformers.ex#L5-L9">these five transformations</a> and tested how much of a difference they made:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ue_to_o</code>: replace <em>ue</em> with <em>o</em> (e.g. <em>respuesta</em> &#8594; <em>resposta</em>)</li>
<li><code>ie_to_e</code>: replace <em>ie</em> with <em>e</em> (e.g. <em>siento</em> &#8594; <em>sento</em>)</li>
<li><code>ion_to_io</code>: replace _ión at the end of a word with <em>ió</em> (e.g. <em>introducción</em> &#8594; <em>introducció</em>)</li>
<li><code>drop_o</code>: get rid of <em>o</em> at the end of a word (e.g. <em>agosto</em> &#8594; <em>agost</em>)</li>
<li><code>drop_e</code>: get rid of <em>e</em> at the end of a word (e.g. <em>verde</em> &#8594; <em>verd</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the transformations (e.g. <code>ie_to_e</code>) are only marginally effective, whereas others are surprisingly useful (e.g. <code>drop_e</code> letters which boosts similarity by 4 or 5% in absolute terms).</p>

<p>Applied one after another, these five simple transformations increase the word similarity from 14% to 25% for the Wikibooks data, and from 9% to 14% for the construction data!</p>

<h2 id="how-reliable-are-these-results-for-real-texts">How reliable are these results for real texts?</h2>

<p>The main challenge with this experiment was getting my hands on clean data – as is often the case.</p>

<p>The Wikibooks data is very limited, only containing about 700 words and lots of proper nouns. As for the construction lexicon, firstly it contains lots of multi-word phrases (on which this word-by-word transformation is ineffective) and secondly, it naturally includes <strong>lots</strong> of trade jargon.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s notable that neither data source includes verb conjugations, which I think would be rich pickings for the vowel transformation rules. It&rsquo;s a <strong>very</strong> common for Spanish irregular verbs to smush a stressed vowel into a pair of vowels.</p>

<h2 id="elixir-as-an-implementation-language">Elixir as an implementation language</h2>

<p>Originally, I wanted to use Elixir for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;ve greatly enjoyed using it for work and play before, and want to keep my hand in</li>
<li>pattern matching sits at the very core of the language philosophy and I was hoping it would be convenient for this sort of pattern matching task</li>
</ol>

<p>In reality, #1 has proven to be true. I love the language, tooling, and community, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to using it even more.</p>

<p>#2 turned out <strong>not</strong> to apply. The vast majority of the time I spent was in looking for and subsequently cleaning the data. The majority of the Elixir code I wrote was to handle the application of the transformations, and measuring accuracy in a convenient way.</p>

<p>The actual transformations themselves were literally <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/translate/blob/c5ea1dc90a709cd5dbfa77d1f39a03c818ee536f/lib/translate/transformers.ex#L5-L9">those five lines of code</a>. Testament to the power of Elixir, but not really a game-changing choice for how tidy this part of the implementation was.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps-to-try">Next steps to try</h2>

<p>I kept this short and sweet as a starting point, but there&rsquo;s lots more to experiment with here if I have a chance:</p>

<ul>
<li>more transformations (e.g. I just noticed that <code>~r/ada$/</code> &#8594; <em>at</em> is a common pattern)</li>
<li>scrape <a href="http://www.verbs.cat/en/">verbs.cat</a> and conflate with <a href="http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/VERBLIST.HTM">Fred Jehle&rsquo;s Spanish conjugations</a> in order to test the transformations on conjugated verbs</li>
<li>implement a statistic based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein edit distance</a> rather than exact matches</li>
<li>track which transformations <strong>harm</strong> accuracy along with the benefits they bring – what&rsquo;s the best order to apply the transformations in to prevent &ldquo;cannibalisation&rdquo;?</li>
<li>could a machine learning approach be used, where it learns a set of rules from the training data rather than me ham-fisting them together?</li>
<li>&laquo;your idea here: <a href="https://twitter.com/goodgravy">digues-me!</a>&raquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not promoting this as a good or sensible way to translate language. Being able to make informed guesses what a Catalan word might be when I know the Spanish equivalent has been incredibly helpful to me: this is merely taking a thought experiment to an illogical extreme.</p>

<p>As it happens, just yesterday a Catalan friend – who doesn&rsquo;t speak Spanish day-to-day – was telling us that while he was on vacation in the south, he had referred to bread as <em>pano</em>, rather than <em>pan</em>. He had taken the Catalan word <em>pa</em> and mis-applied the trailing-O rule (the transformation that I found to be most effective). It goes to show that even native speakers have a set of rules for how to get from one language to another!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>We&rsquo;ve recently started using You Need A Budget (<a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a>) to plan our finances. Unfortunately, like most finance apps it&rsquo;s focussed squarely on the north american market: its automatic transaction importing only works for some US and Canadian banks – and we live and bank in Spain…</p>

<p>YNAB <strong>does</strong> support a manual process, where you upload QFX or OFX files – or CSVs (in their required format). However, our bank (<a href="https://www.bancsabadell.com">Sabadell</a>) supports neither QFX nor OFX, and their CSV format is markedly different from that which YNAB expects in the upload. We were stuck with the prospect of importing every single transaction by hand, or manually downloading a CSV from Sabadell and munging it into a shape that YNAB can understand.</p>

<p>Surely we can do better?</p>

<p>So became <a href="https://github.com/goodgravy/ynabadell"><strong>ynabadell</strong></a> – a tool to automatically import transactions from Sabadell into your YNAB ledger.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Don&rsquo;t video player controls seem dumb?</p>

<p>Desktop and web-based players alike allow the user to jump forwards or backwards by 5 or 10 seconds, or possibly speed up and slow down playback. These controls operate identically no matter what the user is watching – there&rsquo;s no connection between the <strong>content</strong> of the video, and the controls.</p>

<p>DVDs were the first format I know of that allowed you to skip via <strong>chapters</strong>, but even something as basic as those coarse-grained content-aware controls aren&rsquo;t available in things like YouTube videos today.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for how to identify the salient points in a video that a user might want to skip to: the good news is that this could all be done automatically, and with very little overhead; I&rsquo;ll leave the bad news to the end!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>One of the main reasons InnoDB is the go-to choice for our MySQL tables is that it supports row-level locking<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This means that as we&rsquo;re reading from and writing to a table, we don&rsquo;t need to wait for <strong>all</strong> the other processes to finish up their work before we can get access to that table.</p>

<p>For larger tables, this ability to have multiple processes working on the same table at the same time is almost essential to get any level of decent performance, for most workloads.</p>

<p>However, we recently ran into a problem where – because of a detail of how InnoDB and MySQL work – we ended up doing table-level locking rather than row-level, with disastrous results.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/">a discussion on Reddit</a> concerning take-home tests as part of an interview process. Is it was acceptable for companies to ask candidates to work on a problem in their own time, so that their submitted solution helps decide whether to move forwards to an on-site interview?</p>

<p>The level of antipathy towards take-home tests in that discussion was an enormous surprise. The majority of commenters were not just against the idea, but <strong>virulently</strong> so, railing against it as another example of unreasonable demands made on candidates. Most people viewed these tests as a waste of time, rude, disrespectful, or a combination of all three. I think there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rdogv/dont_do_the_long_take_home_assignments_like/dsw9cmk/">only one person</a> whose opinion wasn&rsquo;t negative, and even that was ambivalent at best.</p>

<p>I have been asked to do take-home tests in the past, and did see that if poorly conceived and executed they can be a bad experience for the candidate. However, if they&rsquo;re approached in a thoughtful and careful way, they&rsquo;re one of the best tools for effective interviewing. Here&rsquo;s what I think does—and doesn&rsquo;t—work.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>I&rsquo;m currently learning Catalan and Spanish, and am reminded every day of the languages&rsquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">shared ancestor</a> by how often they share similar (or identical) words.</p>

<p>For example, it&rsquo;s easy to deduce that <em>introducción</em> (in Spanish) means the same as <em>introducció</em> (in Catalan), or that <em>respuesta</em> and <em>resposta</em> are the same thing.</p>

<p>In fact, when you look at the Spanish and Catalan words next to each other, it seems that the same kinds of transformations crop up again and again: consonants becoming repeated, vowels being dropped off the ends of words, stressed vowels changing in predictable ways, …</p>

<p>Of course, the languages are very different and often use completely distinct words, but it got me thinking: how reliably can we guess a Catalan word from a Spanish one, using just a small set of simple transformations?</p>
